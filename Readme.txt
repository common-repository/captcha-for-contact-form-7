> Did you find this plugin helpful? Please consider [leaving a 5-star review](http://wordpress.org/support/view/plugin-reviews/captcha-for-contact-form-7).

Captcha protection can be activated globally for all forms or only locally for specific forms.

Additional settings like the time based protection allows you to define, how often a visitor can submit a form between two time periods. This will allow
you to easily stop bots from using forms over and over again to send multiple spam messages.

It is also possible to activate a timer which will pretend form submitting for a given period. Depending on the form, only bots will be able
to submit these within seconds. Therefor you can enable this function to use this advantage to identify bots and stop them from sending spam.

The captcha plugin is easy to use, everything can be manged from the custom interface which will allow you to enable all necessary settings within
seconds.1
